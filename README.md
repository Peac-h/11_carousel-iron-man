# Project 11 - CSS Carousel & Iron Man

This is a css carousel inspired by the [100dayscss](https://100dayscss.com/) challenges.

This is a small project with the purpose to level up my css animation skills.

Made fully responsive for all screen sizes, with some changes for non-hover devices.

**Hope you'll like it.**
